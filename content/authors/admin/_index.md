Biologist with seven years of experience studying neuroscience mechanisms and novel treatments, and an additional two years studying techniques like optogenetics and chemical extraction. 


Diverse experiences and familiarity with various techniques, including {culturing of mammalian primary neuron cultures without use of antibiotics (aseptic technique only)}, {electrophysiology of hippocampal slice cultures}, {in-vivo neurotraumatic surgery (rmTBI & SCI)}, and {fundamental neuroscience techniques (western blotting, IHC, behavior)}, with extensive knowledge of mitochondria.

Excited to learn more about the edges of the field, including approaches for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration and interested in accelerating the benchside-to-patient pipeline. Looking forward to learning new techniques in the realms of bioinformatics, nanotechnology, biofabrication, biosensors, drug development, mitochondrial therapeutics, toxicants tied to neurodegeneration, brain-machine interface technology, neuromorphic computing, neural networks, computational neuroscience, and deep learning/AI applications in medical neuroscience. 

Also passionate about biodiversity, languages, and livingry.
